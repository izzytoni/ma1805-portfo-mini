   This emoji accurately reflects the emotions of frustrations I had when figuring out variables for the first time - and more specifically how my eyes were feeling under fluorescent lights with contact lenses....
   I used 'erratic' variables and an effect of flashing coloured lights to convey the emotion better
 
2. Movement = https://izzytoni.github.io/ma1805-portfo-mini/02.movement/
   Unrequited love. The adrenaline of the chase represented by a simple canvas and heart creeping away from the initiator. I used variables and mouse clicked to create this movement.

3. Multiples = https://izzytoni.github.io/ma1805-portfo-mini/03.multiples/
  The physical and metaphysical reliqueshing of daily habits, whether good or bad. The repetitive nature of my own painted canvas came together using loops, with added arrays being used for the text. I painted the inital tiles using krita to create a moody, melancholy atmosphere for the windowed, apartment cityscape.
 
4. Media = https://izzytoni.github.io/ma1805-portfo-mini/04.media/
  The 5 stages of puppydog. My golden labradoodle puppy Maud makes her debut. This conveys external images in the vs code software. Understandably, I recognise I could have used a preload option perhaps but this accurately conveys what i was going for regardless.
